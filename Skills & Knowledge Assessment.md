# Networking and Cybersecurity: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Network analysis, whether analyzing my home network or a business network, was easy to interpret.
- Nessus was particularly helpful in learning about and analyzing networks.
- Tools such as Zenmap, Wireshark, and ShieldsUP! were easy to use and effective for running scans.
- Creating and interpreting visualizations in this course was straightforward.
- I retained much of the knowledge in this class due to my strong interest in the subject.
- Using Python for coding tasks in this course made assignments easier to complete, understand, and interpret.

## Weaknesses
- Due to my inexperience in this subject, some terminology was difficult to grasp.
- I was unable to analyze a large business network with multiple devices.
- Zenmap scans took significantly longer than expected.
- I struggled with the Daubert Standard assignment.
- Certain sections of the Fraud Detection Handbook were difficult to comprehend.

## Wants/Wishes
- Gain more experience with larger network environments and complex network topologies.
- Develop a deeper understanding of cybersecurity risk assessments and penetration testing.
- Master advanced forensic techniques for fraud detection and cybersecurity.
